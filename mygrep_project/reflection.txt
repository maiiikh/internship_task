#Breakdown of how my script works:

-First, I check if the user asked for help (--help).

-I use getopts to read options -n and -v.

-After options are handled, I read the search_string and filename.

-I check if the file exists.

-I read the file line by line.

-I check if each line matches the search string, case-insensitively.

-If -v is given, I invert the result.

-If -n is given, I add the line number before the line.

-I print the matching lines.

If I wanted to add regex support or -c, -l:

I would use internal grep commands.

I would build a string of options like grep_options.

Then call grep $grep_options "$search_string" "$filename".

#Hardest part:

Handling inverted match was difficult because Bash doesn't have easy true/false flipping.
