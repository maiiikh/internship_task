1. Problem Analysis:**

The task was to diagnose the issue where the service at `internal.example.com` is unreachable, and users are receiving the "Host not found" error, even though the service is up and running.

2. DNS Resolution Check:

- When attempting to resolve `internal.example.com` to an IP address using the `dig` tool, the result was as follows:
  
```bash
<<>> DiG 9.18.30-0ubuntu0.24.04.2-Ubuntu <<>> internal.example.com
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NXDOMAIN, id: 59584
;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1
```

- **Result**: `NXDOMAIN` indicates that DNS could not resolve `internal.example.com` to an IP address, suggesting an issue with DNS configuration.

3. Service Reachability Check:

- After modifying the `/etc/hosts` file to manually resolve the domain name, I was able to get an IP. However, when trying to ping or curl to the IP address, I received the following result:

```bash
From 192.168.1.4 icmp_seq=3 Destination Host Unreachable
```

- result: The IP address was reachable, but the service was not accessible (`Destination Host Unreachable`), indicating a network issue.

Possible Causes of the Issue**:

1. DNS Issue:
   - The DNS server might not be configured correctly on the server.
   - There could be an issue with the DNS record setup.

2. Network Issue:
   - The IP address of the server might be incorrect.
   - The service on the server might be down or unreachable.
   - There could be a firewall blocking access to the service.
   - There might be a routing or network configuration problem.

Proposed Fixes:

1.Fixing the DNS Issue:

- Steps to confirm the root cause**: Check if the DNS records are set up correctly on the server using tools like `nslookup` or `dig`.
  
- Commands to fix:
  - Check and edit the `/etc/resolv.conf` file to ensure correct DNS servers are set:
  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
  ```
  - Add a valid DNS server, for example, Google's DNS (`8.8.8.8`):
  ```
  nameserver 8.8.8.8
  ```

2.Fixing the Network Issue:

- steps to confirm the root cause**: Ensure that the server is running and that no firewall is blocking access. Test connectivity using tools like `telnet` or `ss`.
  
- Commands to fix:
  - Use `telnet` to test connectivity to the service on port 80:
  ```bash
  telnet <IP_ADDRESS> 80
  ```
  - Check if the service is running on the expected IP:
  ```bash
  ss -tuln | grep 80
